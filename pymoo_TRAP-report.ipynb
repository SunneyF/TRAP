    "**Summary**:\n",
    "The conclusion of the report is that when using NSGA-II/NSGA-III without providing any initial solution we are not able to find any feasible solution even after three hours of computations. Secondly, when we provide initial solutions still the resulting efficient frontier is not superior to our proposed approach. In this report we have only shown computations for one of the instance. "

    "As visible from above log no feasible solution was found. Note that <code>cv (min)</code> is the minumum constraint voilation and <code>cv (avg)</code> the average voilation. The computations were done for 3 hours. A total of 30 iterations were concluded in 3 hours. See [Logfile](https://pymoo.org/interface/display.html) for documentation on displyed items. One of the possible reasons that each iteration is slow is that for a given $\\mathbf{x}$ computing $\\mathbf{z}$ requires solving a LP (see Proposition 3 in the manuscript). Also length of the vector of variables is <code> problems.n_var=494747</code>. The structure of the problem with various auxilary variables also does not help. Hence, it might be helpful if we can initialize with a few feasible solutions such that we have a better chance of finding efficient solutions."
